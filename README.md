### Fork the repository (repo)

- If you're not sure, here's how to [fork the repo](https://help.github.com/en/articles/fork-a-repo)

### Set up your local environment (optional)

If you're ready to contribute and create your PR

1. Clone your fork

If this is your first time forking our repo, this is all you need to do for this step:

```
$ git clone git@github.com:[your_github_handle]
https://github.com/QueenRenee/Tranche-Finance.git

```

If you've already forked the repo, you'll want to ensure your fork is configured and that it's up to date. This will save you the headache of potential merge conflicts.

To [configure your fork](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/configuring-a-remote-for-a-fork):

```
$ git remote add upstream https://github.com/QueenRenee/Tranche-Finance.git

<!-- add the tranche link here -->
```

To [sync your fork with the latest changes](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/syncing-a-fork):

```

$ git checkout dev

$ git fetch upstream

$ git merge upstream/dev

```

2. Add personal GitHub API token (free)

We recommend setting this up when running the project locally, as we use the GitHub API to fetch repository data for many projects & files.

> - [Follow these instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token) to create a personal GitHub API token
>   - When selecting scopes in step 7, leave everything unchecked (the data we fetch doesn't require any [scope](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/apps/scopes-for-oauth-apps#available-scopes))
> - In local repo root directory: Make a copy of `.env.example` and name it `.env`
> - Copy & paste your new GitHub API token into `.env`

```
// .env Example:
GATSBY_GITHUB_TOKEN_READ_ONLY=48f84de812090000demo00000000697cf6e6a059
```

3. Add Etherscan API token (free)

> - [Create an account](https://etherscan.io/) on Etherscan
> - Navigate to your Account Settings page
> - In the sidebar, click on 'API-KEYs' and add a new token
> - Copy & paste your Api-Key Token from Etherscan into `.env`

```
// .env Example:
ETHERSCAN_API_KEY=1E1YGJQ29BE4UKHVCDT43CZ8R
```

4. Add DeFiPulse API token (free)

> - [Follow this guide](https://docs.defipulse.com/quick-start-guide) to create an account and get your DeFiPulse API token
> - Copy & paste your Active API Key from DeFiPulse into `.env`

```
// .env Example:
DEFI_PULSE_API_KEY=<your Defi Pulse key here>
```

## Website conventions / best practices

### ❗️ Translation initiative

_Please read carefully if adding or altering any written language content_

How to prepare your content for translation depends on whether you're working on a simple Markdown/MDX page or a React component page.

**- MDX pages (`/src/content/page/`)**

Markdown will be translated as whole pages of content, so no specific action is required. Simply create a new folder within `/src/content/` with the name of the page, then place index markdown file (ie. `index.md`) within new folder.

**- React component page**

- **English text should be placed into `/src/intl/en/page-CORRESPONDING-PAGE.json`**
- [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/) is the platform we use to manage & crowdsource translation efforts. Please use the following conventions to help streamline this process.
- Use kebab casing (utilizing-dashes-between-words) for file names and JSON keys
- Use standard sentence casing for entry values
  - If capitalization styling required, it is preferable to style with CSS
    - Do this:
      ```
        JSON `"page-warning": "Be very careful"`
        CSS `text-transform: uppercase`
      ```
    - Not this:
      ```
        JSON `"page-warning": "BE VERY CAREFUL"`
      ```
  - This minimizes issues during translation, and allows consistent styling to all languages
- _Please avoid_ embedding links within a sentence. For a word/phrase to be a link, it requires a key/string in the intl JSON. If this is in the middle of another sentence, this results in the sentence being broken into multiple pieces, and requires coding the sentence structure into the JavaScript.

  - This results in significant challenges during translation process, as written syntax for each language will very in terms of ordering subjects/verbs/etc.
  - If you're wanting to link to something within your sentence, create a link at the end of the sentence or paragraph:

  ```
  <p>All Ethereum transactions require a fee, known as Gas, that gets paid to the miner. <Link to="link">More on Gas</Link></p>
  ```

  Once, you've addded your English content to the appropriate JSON file, the above code should look something more like:

  ```
   <p><Translation id="page-transactions" />{" "}<Link to="link"><Translation id="page-transactions-gas-link" /></Link></p>
  ```

  - _tl;dr Each individual JSON entry should be a complete phrase by itself_

- This is done using the `Translation` component. However there is an alternative method for regular JS: `gatsby-plugin-intl` with `/src/utils/translations.js`

  - **Method one: `<Translation />` component (preferred if only needed in JSX)**

    ```
    import { Translation } from "src/components/Translation"

    // Utilize in JSX using
    <Translation id="language-json-key" />
    ```

  - **Method two: `translateMessageId()`**

    ```
    import { useIntl } from "gatsby-plugin-intl"
    import { translateMessageId } from "src/utils/translations"

    // Utilize anywhere in JS using
    const intl = useIntl()
    translateMessageId("language-json-key", intl)
    ```

    ```
    const siteTitle = translateMessageId("site-title", intl)
    ```

## React Hooks

- Components and pages are written using arrow function syntax with React hooks in lieu of using class-based components

```
// Example
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react'

const ComponentName = props => {
  // useState hook for managing state variables
  const [greeting, setGreeting] = useState('')

  useEffect(() => {
    // useEffect hook for handling component lifecycle
    setGreeting('Hello world')
  }, [])

  return <div>{greeting}</div>
};

export default ComponentName;
```

## Styling

- `src/theme.js` - Declares site color themes, breakpoints and other constants (try to utilize these colors first)
- We use [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/)

  - Tagged template literals are used to style custom components

  ```
  // Example of styling syntax using styled-components

  import styled from "styled-components"

  const GenericButton = styled.div`
    width: 200px;
    height: 50px;
  `
  const PrimaryButton = styled(GenericButton)`
    background: blue;
  `
  const SecondaryButton = styled(GenericButton)`
    background: red;
  `

  // These are each components, capitalized by convention, and can be used within JSX code
  // ie: <PrimaryButton>Text</PrimaryButton>
  ```

  - Recommended VS Code Plugin: `vscode-styled-components` <br>To install: Open VS Code > `Ctrl+P` / `Cmd+P` > Run: <br>`ext install vscode-styled-components`

- Values from `src/theme.js` are automatically passed as a prop object to styled components

  ```
  // Example of theme.js usage

  import styled from "styled-components"

  const Container = styled.div`
    background: ${(props) => props.theme.colors.background};
    @media (max-width: ${(props) => props.theme.breakpoints.s}) {
      font-size: #{(props) => props.theme.fontSized.s};
    }
  `
  ```

- [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) - An open source and production-ready motion library for React on the web, used for our animated designs
- **Emojis**: We use [Twemoji](https://twemoji.twitter.com/), an open-source emoji set created by Twitter. These are hosted by us, and used to provide a consistent experience across operating systems.

```
// Example of emoji use
import Emoji from "./Emoji"

// Within JSX:
<Emoji text=":star:" size={1} /> // sized in `em`
```

- **Icons**: We use [React Icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/)
  - `src/components/Icon.js` is the component used to import icons to be used
  - If an icon you want to use is not listed you will need to add it to this file

`src/components/Icon.js`:

```
// Example of how to add new icon not listed
import { ZzIconName } from "react-icons/zz"

// Then add to IconContect.Provider children:
{name === "alias" && <ZzIconName />}
```

From React component:

```
// Example of icon use
import Icon from "./Icon"

// Within JSX:
<Icon name="alias" />
```

## Image loading and API calls using GraphQL

- [Gatsby + GraphQL](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/graphql/) used for loading of images and preferred for API calls (in lieu of REST, if possible/practical). Utilizes static page queries that run at build time, not at run time, optimizing performance
- Image loading example:

```
import { graphql } from "gatsby"

export const query = graphql`
  query {
    hero: file(relativePath: { eq: "developers-eth-blocks.png" }) {
      childImageSharp {
        fluid(maxWidth: 800) {
          ...GatsbyImageSharpFluid
        }
      }
    }
  }
`
// These query results get passed as an object `props.data` to your component
```

- API call example:

```
import { graphql } from "gatsby"

export const repoInfo = graphql`
  fragment repoInfo on GitHub_Repository {
    stargazerCount
    languages(orderBy: { field: SIZE, direction: DESC }, first: 2) {
      nodes {
        name
      }
    }
    url
  }
`
export const query = graphql`
  query {
    hardhatGitHub: github {
      repository(owner: "nomiclabs", name: "hardhat") {
        ...repoInfo
      }
    }
  }
`
// These query results get passed as an object `props.data` to your component
```
